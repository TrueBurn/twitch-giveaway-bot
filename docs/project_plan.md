# Twitch Giveaway Bot Project Plan

## Project Overview
A serverless Twitch bot for managing stream giveaways, replacing Firebot functionality. The bot will handle giveaway entries via chat commands, manage user entries in a database, and provide both an admin interface and OBS overlay for winner announcements.

## Core Features
- Twitch bot with WebSocket connection for chat commands
- Serverless deployment on Vercel
- Supabase database integration
- Admin UI for giveaway management
- OBS overlay for winner announcements
- Twitch authentication for bot and admin access
